 * 
 * 274. H-Index
 * 
 * Medium
 * 
 * Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a
 * researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
 * 
 * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h
 * if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h
 * papers have no more than h citations each."
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
 * 
 * Output: 3
 * 
 * Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each
 * of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the
 * researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two
 * with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
 * 
 * Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as
 * the h-index.
 * 
 * Time O(n) Space O(n)
