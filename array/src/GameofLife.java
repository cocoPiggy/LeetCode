 * 289. Game of Life

 * Medium
 * 
 * According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as
 * Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John
 * Horton Conway in 1970."
 * 
 * Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or
 * dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical,
 * diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia
 * article):
 * 
 * Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by
 * under-population.
 * 
 * Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next
 * generation.
 * 
 * Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by
 * over-population..
 * 
 * Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by
 * reproduction.
 * 
 * Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board
 * given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above
 * rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and
 * deaths occur simultaneously.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input:
 * 
 * [ [0,1,0], [0,0,1], [1,1,1], [0,0,0] ]
 * 
 * Output:
 * 
 * [ [0,0,0], [1,0,1], [0,1,1], [0,1,0] ]
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * 
 * Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at
 * the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated
 * values to update other cells.
 * 
 * In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the
 * board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches
 * the border of the array. How would you address these problems?
